I just thought this one through.

I took the cost of the last move out of the equation. Meaning I had 30 tokens to land on the 4 or 8.

The minimum number of moves to get from * to the 4 or 8 was 8.  The average cost of the 8 moves was 3.75.

The board required taking an 8 which counted for more than 2 moves. Looking at the map I noted a path through the one that summed to 29, and then one to 27.  At this point I tried to wrap around the map even though the directions led me to believe it was not possible (mentioned falling off the map).  Thinking about wrapping let me to think about repeating a move.  the path that summed to 27 already passed through the 1 next to the 2.  The solution was pretty obvious from here.

If I had to guess how I'd implement this, I'd probably start with decision trees.
